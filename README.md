# about-me

Heya, my name is Damien AKA Visual (Online Name).

I'm from Germany, I'm 15 and a self taught software developer. I also edit on TikTok.
I program in languages like: C/C++/D/ASM/Python

I started my programming career at a very young age starting with C -> ASM -> C++ -> Python -> D. I always had passion for low level development and I hope to contribute to any BSD someday to bring It Improvements.

Mainly I like to program in the low level zone, meaning i often do very complex and direct things talking to my machine.

As a daily driver I use: FreeBSD

I also play football/futsal, and Im a ***huge*** Ronaldinho fanboy. Yes I am decent at dribbling, and I hope that I will become like him one day.
Position I play in: Right Winger

>And part of brazilian portuguese
