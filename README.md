# about-me

Heya, my name is Damien AKA Visual (Online Name).

I'm from Germany, I'm 15 and a self taught software developer.
I program in languages like: C/C++/D/ASM/Python

Mainly I like to program in the low level zone, meaning i often do very complex and direct things talking to my machine.
Projects: BSD-lite (BSD-4.4-lite2 fork), Unics (Unix-like operating system), Bunix (Unix-like operating system).

I also play football, and a ***huge*** Ronaldinho fanboy. Yes I am decent at dribbling, and I hope that I will become like him one day.
Position I play in: Right Winger

I am sorry if you have to view this through GitHub but I don't have any other option right now.
